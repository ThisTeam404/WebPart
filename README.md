# Project Ttitle
LockThatDown - Website Component

# Project Description
The goal of this project is to have an app that generates key pins for door locks.
This app will be used by a locksmith who currently has to manually come up with
different key pins each time he works on a job.

This respository is for the website that will display the saved key pins. Each time 
the locksmith works on a lock he'll generate the key pins on the iphone and save it
on our database. He can retrieve the key pins in the future by looking it up from 
the database using the website interface. There is another respository that holds the
iphone codes.
